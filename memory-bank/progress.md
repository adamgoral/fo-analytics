- **Authentication Implementation**: JWT/SSO code not written
- **API Endpoints**: Beyond health checks, no business endpoints
- **Frontend Pages**: No actual UI components or pages built
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana stack not configured

## Known Issues
None at this stage - project is in pre-implementation phase

## Technical Debt
None accumulated yet - clean slate for implementation

## Key Decisions Log

### January 2025
1. **Technology Stack Selected**
   - Backend: Python/FastAPI over Django (better async support)
   - Frontend: React/TypeScript over Vue (larger ecosystem)
   - AI: Anthropic Claude over OpenAI (better strategy extraction)
   - Package Manager: uv over pip/poetry (faster, more reliable)

2. **Infrastructure Decisions** (July 22, 2025)
   - Docker Compose for local development (vs individual containers)
   - PostgreSQL 15 for stability (vs PostgreSQL 16)
   - GitHub Actions for CI/CD (vs GitLab CI or Jenkins)
   - MinIO for local S3 compatibility (vs LocalStack)

3. **Development Workflow**
   - Makefile for common commands
   - Hot-reloading in development containers
   - Separate dev and prod Dockerfiles
   - Database initialization via SQL scripts

4. **Data Access Architecture** (July 22, 2025)
   - Repository pattern over direct ORM usage (better testability)
   - Unit of Work for transaction boundaries (data consistency)
   - Async-first approach (performance at scale)
   - Type-safe generics implementation (catch errors early)

2. **Architecture Decisions**
   - Microservices over monolith (scalability requirements)
   - Event-driven over synchronous (better decoupling)
   - PostgreSQL over MongoDB (complex relationships)
   - Kubernetes over serverless (predictable costs)

3. **Development Practices**
   - TDD approach for quality
   - DDD for complex domain modeling
   - Memory bank for context persistence
   - Agile with 2-week sprints

## Metrics & KPIs

### Development Metrics (To Track)
- Story points completed per sprint
- Code coverage percentage
- Build success rate
- Deployment frequency

### Business Metrics (Target)
- Time to MVP: 3 months
- Beta users: 10 institutions
- Strategy extraction accuracy: >95%
- Document processing time: <5 minutes

## Lessons Learned

### From Planning Phase
1. **Comprehensive Documentation Pays Off**: Detailed PRD/BRD provides clear direction
2. **User Stories Drive Development**: 43 well-defined stories create clear roadmap
3. **Architecture First**: Upfront design decisions prevent costly refactoring
4. **Market Validation Critical**: $3.1B SAM justifies investment

### Best Practices Identified
1. **Memory Bank System**: Ensures context persistence across sessions
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Enables scalability from day one
3. **Security by Design**: Enterprise requirements built-in, not bolted on
4. **Observability First**: Monitoring planned before implementation
5. **Repository Pattern**: Clean separation of data access from business logic
6. **Async-First Development**: All database operations are async for scalability

## Risk Register

### Technical Risks
1. **LLM API Costs**: Mitigation - Implement caching and prompt optimization
2. **Scaling Complexity**: Mitigation - Start with Kubernetes architecture
3. **Data Security**: Mitigation - Encryption and compliance from start

### Business Risks
1. **Competition**: Several funded competitors in space
2. **Regulatory Changes**: Financial services regulations evolving
3. **User Adoption**: Requires behavior change from manual process

## Key Decisions Log

### January 2025
1. **Technology Stack Selected**
   - Backend: Python/FastAPI over Django (better async support)
   - Frontend: React/TypeScript over Vue (larger ecosystem)
   - AI: Anthropic Claude over OpenAI (better strategy extraction)
   - Package Manager: uv over pip/poetry (faster, more reliable)

### July 22, 2025
2. **Infrastructure Decisions**
   - Docker Compose for local development (vs individual containers)
   - PostgreSQL 15 for stability (vs PostgreSQL 16)
   - GitHub Actions for CI/CD (vs GitLab CI or Jenkins)
   - MinIO for local S3 compatibility (vs LocalStack)

3. **Development Workflow**
   - Makefile for common commands
   - Hot-reloading in development containers
   - Separate dev and prod Dockerfiles
   - Database initialization via SQL scripts

4. **Data Access Architecture**
   - Repository pattern over direct ORM usage (better testability)
   - Unit of Work for transaction boundaries (data consistency)
   - Async-first approach (performance at scale)
   - Type-safe generics implementation (catch errors early)

5. **Authentication Architecture**
   - JWT tokens over session-based auth (stateless, scalable)
   - Separate access/refresh tokens (security best practice)
   - Role-based access control built-in (enterprise requirement)
   - Bcrypt for password hashing (industry standard)

6. **Logging Architecture**
   - Structlog over standard logging (structured JSON output)
   - Environment-based formatting (JSON prod, colored dev)
   - Request tracing with unique IDs (distributed debugging)
   - Automatic sensitive data censoring (security compliance)

7. **API Design Decisions**
   - RESTful design with clear resource boundaries
   - Pydantic for request/response validation
   - Consistent error response format
   - OpenAPI documentation auto-generation

8. **Frontend Architecture**
   - Redux Toolkit for state management (type-safe, modern)
   - Material-UI for component library (enterprise look)
   - Axios for API communication (interceptor support)
   - Feature-based folder structure (scalability)

2. **Architecture Decisions**
   - Microservices over monolith (scalability requirements)
   - Event-driven over synchronous (better decoupling)
   - PostgreSQL over MongoDB (complex relationships)
   - Kubernetes over serverless (predictable costs)

3. **Development Practices**
   - TDD approach for quality
   - DDD for complex domain modeling
   - Memory bank for context persistence
   - Agile with 2-week sprints

## Metrics & KPIs

## Lessons Learned

### From Planning Phase
1. **Comprehensive Documentation Pays Off**: Detailed PRD/BRD provides clear direction
2. **User Stories Drive Development**: 43 well-defined stories create clear roadmap
3. **Architecture First**: Upfront design decisions prevent costly refactoring
4. **Market Validation Critical**: $3.1B SAM justifies investment

### Best Practices Identified
1. **Memory Bank System**: Ensures context persistence across sessions
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Enables scalability from day one
3. **Security by Design**: Enterprise requirements built-in, not bolted on
4. **Observability First**: Monitoring planned before implementation
5. **Repository Pattern**: Clean separation of data access from business logic
6. **Async-First Development**: All database operations are async for scalability
7. **JWT Authentication**: Stateless auth for microservices architecture
8. **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic separated from API endpoints
9. **Structured Logging**: JSON logs ready for aggregation systems
10. **Type Safety**: TypeScript frontend, Pydantic backend validation
11. **Dependency Injection**: FastAPI's DI system for testability
12. **Middleware Pipeline**: Cross-cutting concerns handled centrally
13. **Clean Import Structure**: Python packages configured without src. prefix for cleaner imports
14. **Test-Driven Development**: 84% test coverage achieved with comprehensive test suite
15. **Async Testing Patterns**: Proper fixtures and patterns for testing async code
16. **Coverage Configuration**: Exclude example/generated files from coverage metrics
17. **LlamaIndex Integration**: Superior document parsing compared to traditional libraries
18. **Storage Service Patterns**: Clean abstraction over S3/MinIO operations
19. **Docker Environment Variables**: Proper PYTHONPATH configuration for module imports
20. **Database Initialization**: Manual table creation scripts for development setup

## Risk Register

### Technical Risks
1. **LLM API Costs**: Mitigation - Implement caching and prompt optimization
2. **Scaling Complexity**: Mitigation - Start with Kubernetes architecture
3. **Data Security**: Mitigation - Encryption and compliance from start

### Business Risks
1. **Competition**: Several funded competitors in space
2. **Regulatory Changes**: Financial services regulations evolving
3. **User Adoption**: Requires behavior change from manual process

### Phase 2: MVP Development (Not Started - Target: March-April 2025)
- [ ] Document upload service
- [ ] LLM integration for strategy extraction
- [ ] Basic web UI
- [ ] Simple backtesting integration
- [ ] User management

### Phase 3: Beta Release (Not Started - Target: May-June 2025)
- [ ] Advanced backtesting features
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security hardening
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] Beta user onboarding

## Current Status

### What Works
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive planning documents completed
- **Architecture**: Well-defined microservices design
- **Requirements**: Clear user stories with acceptance criteria
- **Market Validation**: Strong business case with $3.1B SAM

### What's In Progress
- **Memory Bank**: System for maintaining project context (just initialized)
- **Development Planning**: Ready to begin implementation

### What's Not Started
- **Code Implementation**: No source code yet
- **Infrastructure**: No cloud resources provisioned
- **Development Environment**: Not configured
- **Testing Framework**: Not set up
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Not created

## Known Issues
None at this stage - project is in pre-implementation phase

## Technical Debt
None accumulated yet - clean slate for implementation

## Key Decisions Log

### January 2025
1. **Technology Stack Selected**
   - Backend: Python/FastAPI over Django (better async support)
   - Frontend: React/TypeScript over Vue (larger ecosystem)
   - AI: Anthropic Claude over OpenAI (better strategy extraction)
   - Package Manager: uv over pip/poetry (faster, more reliable)

2. **Architecture Decisions**
   - Microservices over monolith (scalability requirements)
   - Event-driven over synchronous (better decoupling)
   - PostgreSQL over MongoDB (complex relationships)
   - Kubernetes over serverless (predictable costs)

3. **Development Practices**
   - TDD approach for quality
   - DDD for complex domain modeling
   - Memory bank for context persistence
   - Agile with 2-week sprints

## Metrics & KPIs

### Development Metrics (To Track)
- Story points completed per sprint
- Code coverage percentage
- Build success rate
- Deployment frequency

### Business Metrics (Target)
- Time to MVP: 3 months
- Beta users: 10 institutions
- Strategy extraction accuracy: >95%
- Document processing time: <5 minutes

## Lessons Learned

### From Planning Phase
1. **Comprehensive Documentation Pays Off**: Detailed PRD/BRD provides clear direction
2. **User Stories Drive Development**: 43 well-defined stories create clear roadmap
3. **Architecture First**: Upfront design decisions prevent costly refactoring
4. **Market Validation Critical**: $3.1B SAM justifies investment

### Best Practices Identified
1. **Memory Bank System**: Ensures context persistence across sessions
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Enables scalability from day one
3. **Security by Design**: Enterprise requirements built-in, not bolted on
4. **Observability First**: Monitoring planned before implementation

## Risk Register

### Technical Risks
1. **LLM API Costs**: Mitigation - Implement caching and prompt optimization
2. **Scaling Complexity**: Mitigation - Start with Kubernetes architecture
3. **Data Security**: Mitigation - Encryption and compliance from start

### Business Risks
1. **Competition**: Several funded competitors in space
2. **Regulatory Changes**: Financial services regulations evolving
3. **User Adoption**: Requires behavior change from manual process

## Next Sprint Planning

### Sprint 1 Goals (February 2025)
1. Set up development environment with uv
2. Initialize backend structure with FastAPI
3. Create basic React/TypeScript frontend
4. Configure Docker Compose for local development
5. Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD
6. Implement basic authentication

### Success Criteria
- Local development environment running
- Basic API endpoints responding
- Frontend can communicate with backend
- Tests passing in CI/CD
- Documentation updated in memory bank

## Communication & Collaboration

### Team Structure (Planned)
- Technical Lead: Overall architecture
- Backend Engineers (2): API and services
- Frontend Engineers (2): UI/UX implementation
- DevOps Engineer: Infrastructure and deployment
- QA Engineer: Testing strategy

### Communication Channels
- Daily standups
- Weekly architecture reviews
- Sprint planning/retrospectives
- Memory bank for async context
- CLAUDE.md for development standards

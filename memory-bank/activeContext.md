# Active Context: Front Office Analytics AI Platform

## Current State (January 2025)

### Project Phase: Implementation Started
The project has moved from planning to active implementation. Basic project structure is in place with both backend and frontend initialized.

### What Exists
- Complete PRD with technical specifications and architecture
- BRD with business requirements and market analysis
- User stories document with 43 implementation-ready stories
- Memory bank system for maintaining project context
- CLAUDE.md with development guidelines
- **Backend**: FastAPI application with health endpoints
  - Dependencies: fastapi, uvicorn, pydantic, sqlalchemy, redis, httpx
  - Dev tools: pytest, ruff, mypy configured
  - Basic API structure at localhost:8000/api/v1
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript application
  - Build tool: Vite for fast development
  - State: Redux Toolkit configured
  - UI: Material-UI installed
  - Router: React Router configured

### What Doesn't Exist Yet
- Docker development environment
- Database schema and migrations
- Authentication implementation
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Cloud deployment configuration
- Actual business logic and features

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Current Sprint)
1. **Project Setup** âœ…
   - âœ… Initialize Python backend with uv package manager
   - âœ… Set up React/TypeScript frontend structure
   - ðŸ”„ Configure Docker development environment
   - ðŸ”„ Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions

2. **Core Architecture**
   - Implement basic FastAPI backend structure
   - Set up database models with SQLAlchemy
   - Configure Redis for caching
   - Set up RabbitMQ for async processing

3. **Development Infrastructure**
   - Docker compose for local development
   - Basic CI/CD with GitHub Actions
   - Linting and formatting setup
   - Initial test framework configuration

### MVP Focus Areas
Based on the PRD, the MVP (3-month target) should focus on:
1. Document upload and storage
2. Basic LLM integration for strategy extraction
3. Simple UI for document management
4. Initial backtesting framework integration

## Key Decisions Made

### Technology Choices
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI (confirmed in PRD)
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **AI Integration**: Anthropic Claude API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistence
- **Queue**: RabbitMQ for async processing
- **Cache**: Redis for performance

### Development Practices
- Use uv for Python package management (not pip/poetry)
- Follow Domain-Driven Design principles
- Implement Test-Driven Development
- Use pydantic for data validation
- Storybook for UI component development

## Current Blockers
None - implementation is progressing smoothly

## Recent Progress
- Created project directory structure following microservices pattern
- Initialized backend with FastAPI and all core dependencies
- Initialized frontend with React/TypeScript/Vite
- Both servers can run independently (backend on :8000, frontend on :5173)

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- Microservices architecture as specified in PRD
- Clear separation between API, business logic, and data layers
- Event-driven communication between services

### Development Workflow
1. Start with core domain models
2. Build API endpoints with full validation
3. Implement async processing for heavy operations
4. Add UI components iteratively

### Quality Standards
- 95%+ test coverage for business logic
- All APIs must have OpenAPI documentation
- Performance metrics tracked from day one
- Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## Learning and Insights

### From Documentation Review
1. The project has exceptional planning depth with clear requirements
2. Market validation shows strong demand ($3.1B SAM)
3. Technical architecture is well-thought-out and scalable
4. User stories provide clear implementation guidance

### Key Success Factors
1. **LLM Integration Quality**: The core value depends on accurate strategy extraction
2. **Processing Speed**: Sub-5 minute processing is critical for user adoption
3. **Enterprise Security**: Must be bank-grade from the start
4. **User Experience**: Intuitive UI for non-technical portfolio managers

### Risk Considerations
1. **LLM API Costs**: Need to optimize token usage for profitability
2. **Scaling Challenges**: Distributed backtesting requires careful orchestration
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Financial services regulations vary by region
4. **Competition**: Fast-moving space with well-funded competitors

## Communication Context
- Using Claude Code for development assistance

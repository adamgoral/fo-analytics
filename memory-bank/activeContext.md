# Active Context: Front Office Analytics AI Platform

## Current State (January 2025)

### Project Phase: Pre-Implementation
The project is currently in the planning and documentation phase. Comprehensive requirements, business context, and user stories have been documented, but no code implementation has begun.

### What Exists
- Complete PRD with technical specifications and architecture
- BRD with business requirements and market analysis
- User stories document with 43 implementation-ready stories
- Memory bank system for maintaining project context
- CLAUDE.md with development guidelines

### What Doesn't Exist Yet
- No source code structure
- No dependency management setup
- No development environment configuration
- No testing framework
- No CI/CD pipeline
- No deployment configuration

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Next Sprint)
1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize Python backend with uv package manager
   - Set up React/TypeScript frontend structure
   - Configure development environment
   - Set up version control workflows

2. **Core Architecture**
   - Implement basic FastAPI backend structure
   - Set up database models with SQLAlchemy
   - Configure Redis for caching
   - Set up RabbitMQ for async processing

3. **Development Infrastructure**
   - Docker compose for local development
   - Basic CI/CD with GitHub Actions
   - Linting and formatting setup
   - Initial test framework configuration

### MVP Focus Areas
Based on the PRD, the MVP (3-month target) should focus on:
1. Document upload and storage
2. Basic LLM integration for strategy extraction
3. Simple UI for document management
4. Initial backtesting framework integration

## Key Decisions Made

### Technology Choices
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI (confirmed in PRD)
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **AI Integration**: Anthropic Claude API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistence
- **Queue**: RabbitMQ for async processing
- **Cache**: Redis for performance

### Development Practices
- Use uv for Python package management (not pip/poetry)
- Follow Domain-Driven Design principles
- Implement Test-Driven Development
- Use pydantic for data validation
- Storybook for UI component development

## Current Blockers
None - project is ready to begin implementation

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- Microservices architecture as specified in PRD
- Clear separation between API, business logic, and data layers
- Event-driven communication between services

### Development Workflow
1. Start with core domain models
2. Build API endpoints with full validation
3. Implement async processing for heavy operations
4. Add UI components iteratively

### Quality Standards
- 95%+ test coverage for business logic
- All APIs must have OpenAPI documentation
- Performance metrics tracked from day one
- Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## Learning and Insights

### From Documentation Review
1. The project has exceptional planning depth with clear requirements
2. Market validation shows strong demand ($3.1B SAM)
3. Technical architecture is well-thought-out and scalable
4. User stories provide clear implementation guidance

### Key Success Factors
1. **LLM Integration Quality**: The core value depends on accurate strategy extraction
2. **Processing Speed**: Sub-5 minute processing is critical for user adoption
3. **Enterprise Security**: Must be bank-grade from the start
4. **User Experience**: Intuitive UI for non-technical portfolio managers

### Risk Considerations
1. **LLM API Costs**: Need to optimize token usage for profitability
2. **Scaling Challenges**: Distributed backtesting requires careful orchestration
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Financial services regulations vary by region
4. **Competition**: Fast-moving space with well-funded competitors

## Communication Context
- Using Claude Code for development assistance
- Memory bank system maintains context between sessions
- All project documents in memory-bank/ directory
- Following CLAUDE.md guidelines for development practices

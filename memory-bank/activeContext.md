# Active Context: Front Office Analytics AI Platform

## Current State (January 2025)

### Project Phase: Implementation Started
The project has moved from planning to active implementation. Basic project structure is in place with both backend and frontend initialized.

### What Exists
- Complete PRD with technical specifications and architecture
- BRD with business requirements and market analysis
- User stories document with 43 implementation-ready stories
- Memory bank system for maintaining project context
- CLAUDE.md with development guidelines
- **Backend**: FastAPI application with health endpoints
  - Dependencies: fastapi, uvicorn, pydantic, sqlalchemy, redis, httpx
  - Dev tools: pytest, ruff, mypy configured
  - Basic API structure at localhost:8000/api/v1
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript application
  - Build tool: Vite for fast development
  - State: Redux Toolkit configured
  - UI: Material-UI installed
  - Router: React Router configured

### What's Been Completed Since Last Update
- ✅ **Docker development environment**: Complete docker-compose.yml with all services
  - PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, MinIO all configured
  - Hot-reloading enabled for both backend and frontend
  - Health checks and proper networking
- ✅ **CI/CD pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflows for CI and CD
  - Automated testing, linting, and security scanning
  - Docker image building and registry push
  - Staging and production deployment stages
- ✅ **Development tooling**: 
  - Makefile with convenient Docker commands
  - Production Dockerfiles for deployment
  - PR/issue templates and CODEOWNERS file
  - Dependabot for automated dependency updates

### What Doesn't Exist Yet
- Database migrations with Alembic (SQLAlchemy models not created yet)
- Authentication implementation (JWT/SSO)
- Cloud deployment configuration (Kubernetes/Terraform)
- Actual business logic and features
- API endpoints beyond health checks
- Frontend components and pages
- LLM integration (Anthropic Claude API)
- Document processing pipeline
- Backtesting framework integration

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Current Sprint)
1. **Project Setup** ✅
   - ✅ Initialize Python backend with uv package manager
   - ✅ Set up React/TypeScript frontend structure
   - ✅ Configure Docker development environment
   - ✅ Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions

### Next Sprint Focus (Sprint 1)
1. **Database & Models**
   - Design and implement SQLAlchemy models (User, Document, Strategy, Backtest)
   - Set up Alembic for database migrations
   - Create repository pattern for data access
   - Add database connection pooling

2. **Authentication & Security**
   - Implement JWT-based authentication
   - Create user registration and login endpoints
   - Set up RBAC foundation
   - Add request validation middleware

3. **Core API Development**
   - Implement base API structure with proper error handling
   - Create first business endpoint (document upload)
   - Set up structured logging with context
   - Add OpenAPI documentation

4. **Frontend Foundation**
   - Create basic layout with navigation
   - Implement authentication flow UI
   - Set up API client with interceptors
   - Create first feature component (document list)

### MVP Focus Areas
Based on the PRD, the MVP (3-month target) should focus on:
1. Document upload and storage
2. Basic LLM integration for strategy extraction
3. Simple UI for document management
4. Initial backtesting framework integration

## Key Decisions Made

### Technology Choices
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI (confirmed in PRD)
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **AI Integration**: Anthropic Claude API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistence
- **Queue**: RabbitMQ for async processing
- **Cache**: Redis for performance

### Development Practices
- Use uv for Python package management (not pip/poetry)
- Follow Domain-Driven Design principles
- Implement Test-Driven Development
- Use pydantic for data validation
- Storybook for UI component development

## Current Blockers
None - implementation is progressing smoothly

## Recent Progress
- Created project directory structure following microservices pattern
- Initialized backend with FastAPI and all core dependencies
- Initialized frontend with React/TypeScript/Vite
- Both servers can run independently (backend on :8000, frontend on :5173)
- **NEW**: Complete Docker development environment with all services
- **NEW**: Database schema designed and implemented
- **NEW**: CI/CD pipelines configured with GitHub Actions
- **NEW**: Development tooling (Makefile, environment configuration)

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- Microservices architecture as specified in PRD
- Clear separation between API, business logic, and data layers
- Event-driven communication between services

### Development Workflow
1. Start with core domain models
2. Build API endpoints with full validation
3. Implement async processing for heavy operations
4. Add UI components iteratively

### Quality Standards
- 95%+ test coverage for business logic
- All APIs must have OpenAPI documentation
- Performance metrics tracked from day one
- Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## Learning and Insights

### From Documentation Review
1. The project has exceptional planning depth with clear requirements
2. Market validation shows strong demand ($3.1B SAM)
3. Technical architecture is well-thought-out and scalable
4. User stories provide clear implementation guidance

### Key Success Factors
1. **LLM Integration Quality**: The core value depends on accurate strategy extraction
2. **Processing Speed**: Sub-5 minute processing is critical for user adoption
3. **Enterprise Security**: Must be bank-grade from the start
4. **User Experience**: Intuitive UI for non-technical portfolio managers

### Risk Considerations
1. **LLM API Costs**: Need to optimize token usage for profitability
2. **Scaling Challenges**: Distributed backtesting requires careful orchestration
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Financial services regulations vary by region
4. **Competition**: Fast-moving space with well-funded competitors

## Communication Context
- Using Claude Code for development assistance
- Memory bank system maintains context between sessions
- All project documents in memory-bank/ directory
- Following CLAUDE.md guidelines for development practices

### Story Card: DP-001 - PDF Upload Component
```
Title: Create PDF upload component with drag-and-drop
ID: FOAP-001
Points: 1
Epic: Document Processing
Sprint: Sprint 1
Priority: Must Have (MoSCoW)

As a Portfolio Manager,
I want to upload PDF research documents via drag-and-drop,
So that I can quickly submit documents for analysis.

Business Context:
Portfolio managers receive 20+ research documents daily via email. A seamless upload experience is critical for adoption. The drag-and-drop interface reduces friction and matches their workflow expectations.
```

### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Feature: PDF Document Upload
  Background:
    Given I am authenticated as a Portfolio Manager
    And I am on the document upload page

  Scenario: Successful drag-and-drop upload
    Given I have a valid PDF file under 100MB
    When I drag the file onto the upload zone
    Then I should see a visual indicator that the drop zone is active
    And when I drop the file
    Then I should see an upload progress bar
    And the file should be uploaded successfully
    And I should see a success message with the document title

  Scenario: Multiple file upload
    Given I have 3 PDF files each under 100MB
    When I select all files and drag them onto the upload zone
    Then I should see individual progress bars for each file
    And all files should upload in parallel
    And I should see success messages for each file

  Scenario: Invalid file type rejection
    Given I have a Word document (.docx)
    When I attempt to drag it onto the upload zone
    Then the drop zone should show a red border
    And I should see an error message "Only PDF files are supported"
    And the file should not be uploaded

  Scenario: File size limit enforcement
    Given I have a PDF file larger than 100MB
    When I attempt to upload it
    Then I should see an error message "File size exceeds 100MB limit"
    And the upload should be prevented
```

### Story Card: DP-002 - Document Status Tracking
```
Title: Implement document processing status tracking
ID: FOAP-002
Points: 1
Epic: Document Processing
Sprint: Sprint 1
Priority: Must Have (MoSCoW)

As a Portfolio Manager,
I want to see the real-time processing status of my uploaded documents,
So that I know when strategies are ready for review.

Business Context:
Document processing takes 2-5 minutes. Users need visibility into progress to avoid re-uploading or wondering if the system is working. Real-time updates build trust in the platform.
```

### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Feature: Document Processing Status
  Background:
    Given I have uploaded a PDF document
    And the document is being processed

  Scenario: Real-time status updates
    Given my document is in "processing" status
    When the backend updates the status
    Then I should see the status change without refreshing
    And the status should show one of: "uploading", "processing", "extracting", "completed", "failed"
    And each status should have an appropriate icon and color

  Scenario: Processing progress indication
    Given my document is being processed
    When I view the document status
    Then I should see a progress percentage
    And the percentage should update at least every 10 seconds
    And I should see estimated time remaining

  Scenario: Processing failure handling
    Given my document processing fails
    When I view the document status
    Then I should see status "failed"
    And I should see a clear error message
    And I should have an option to retry processing
```

## Epic 2: AI Analysis Engine

### Story Card: AI-001 - LLM Strategy Extraction
```
Title: Extract trading strategies using LLM
ID: FOAP-010
Points: 1
Epic: AI Analysis Engine
Sprint: Sprint 3
Priority: Must Have (MoSCoW)

As a System,
I want to use LLM to identify and extract trading strategies from research text,
So that users receive structured, actionable strategy definitions.

Business Context:
Manual strategy extraction takes analysts 2-4 hours per document. LLM-based extraction reduces this to minutes while maintaining high accuracy. This is the core value proposition of the platform.
```

### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Feature: LLM Strategy Extraction
  Background:
    Given a document has been processed and text extracted
    And the document contains one or more trading strategies

  Scenario: Successful strategy extraction
    Given a research document with a momentum strategy
    When the LLM extraction runs
    Then it should identify the strategy name
    And extract entry rules with specific conditions
    And extract exit rules with specific conditions
    And identify all numeric parameters with values
    And assign a confidence score between 0 and 1
    And complete within 30 seconds

  Scenario: Multiple strategy extraction
    Given a document with 3 different strategies
    When the LLM extraction runs
    Then it should identify all 3 strategies separately
    And maintain clear boundaries between strategies
    And not mix parameters between strategies

  Scenario: Low confidence handling
    Given a document with vague strategy description
    When the LLM extraction runs
    Then it should still attempt extraction
    And assign a low confidence score (<0.6)
    And flag specific areas of uncertainty
```

```
Title: Implement conversational AI for strategy Q&A
ID: FOAP-011
Points: 1
Epic: AI Analysis Engine
Sprint: Sprint 4
Priority: Must Have (MoSCoW)

As a Portfolio Manager,
I want to ask questions about extracted strategies in natural language,
So that I can clarify implementation details without reading entire documents.

Business Context:
Extracted strategies often need clarification. Users have specific questions about implementation details, parameters, or market conditions. Conversational AI provides instant, context-aware answers.
```

### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Feature: AI Chat Interface
  Background:
    Given I am viewing an extracted strategy
    And I have questions about implementation

  Scenario: Ask clarifying questions
    Given a momentum strategy with unclear rebalancing
    When I ask "How often should I rebalance this strategy?"
    Then the AI should analyze the source document
    And provide a specific answer with context
    And cite the relevant section of the document
    And respond within 5 seconds

  Scenario: Multi-turn conversation
    Given I've asked an initial question
    When I ask a follow-up question
    Then the AI should maintain conversation context
    And reference my previous questions
    And provide coherent, contextual responses

  Scenario: Implementation guidance
    Given I ask "Show me how to implement the entry logic"
    When the AI responds
    Then it should provide pseudo-code or description
    And explain any complex conditions
    And suggest relevant parameters

Title: Generate executable Python code for strategies
ID: FOAP-012
Points: 1
Epic: AI Analysis Engine
Sprint: Sprint 4
Priority: Must Have (MoSCoW)

As a Quantitative Analyst,
I want to generate Python code for extracted strategies,
So that I can immediately test and modify the implementation.

Business Context:
Converting strategy descriptions to code is time-consuming and error-prone. Automated code generation saves days of work and ensures consistency with the research paper's intent.
```

### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Feature: Python Code Generation
  Background:
    Given an extracted strategy with clear rules
    And I want to implement it in Python

  Scenario: Generate complete strategy code
    Given a momentum strategy with entry/exit rules
    When I request Python code generation
    Then I should receive a complete Python class
    And the code should include all strategy logic
    And use standard backtesting framework (backtrader/zipline)
    And include inline documentation
    And be syntactically valid Python

  Scenario: Include data requirements
    Given a strategy requiring price and volume data
    When code is generated
    Then it should specify required data fields
    And include data validation
    And handle missing data appropriately

  Scenario: Parameter configuration
    Given a strategy with multiple parameters
    When code is generated
    Then parameters should be configurable
    And have default values from the paper
    And include parameter validation
    And document acceptable ranges

Epic: Enterprise Features
Sprint: Sprint 11
Priority: Must Have (MoSCoW)

As an IT Administrator,
I want users to authenticate via our corporate SSO,
So that we maintain security standards and user convenience.

Business Context:
Enterprise clients require integration with their identity providers. SSO reduces password fatigue, improves security, and enables centralized user management.
```

### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Feature: SSO Authentication
  Background:
    Given the platform supports SAML 2.0
    And corporate IdP is configured

  Scenario: SSO login flow

    When I click "Login with SSO"
    Then I'm redirected to corporate IdP
    And after authentication I'm redirected back
    And my session is established
    And profile data is synchronized

  Scenario: Just-in-time provisioning
    Given a new user authenticates via SSO
    When they first access the platform
    Then their account is created automatically
    And roles are assigned based on SAML attributes
    And they land on the onboarding page

  Scenario: SSO logout
    Given I'm logged in via SSO
    When I click logout
    Then I'm logged out of the platform
    And redirected to IdP logout
    And session is terminated completely

### Story Card: EF-002 - Role-Based Access Control
```
Title: Implement granular role-based permissions
ID: FOAP-041
Points: 1
Epic: Enterprise Features
Sprint: Sprint 11
Priority: Must Have (MoSCoW)

As a Compliance Officer,
I want to control user access based on roles,
So that sensitive strategies are protected and audit requirements are met.

Business Context:
Financial institutions require strict access controls. Different teams need different permissions - analysts can create strategies, PMs can approve them, compliance can audit everything.
```

### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Feature: Role-Based Access Control
  Background:
    Given RBAC system is configured
    And multiple roles are defined

  Scenario: Role-based feature access
    Given I'm logged in as an Analyst
    When I access the platform
    Then I can create and edit my strategies
    But cannot approve strategies for production
    And cannot see strategies from other teams
    And cannot access admin functions

  Scenario: Permission inheritance
    Given a hierarchy of roles exists
    When a Senior PM role includes PM permissions
    Then Senior PM can do everything a PM can
    Plus additional senior-level permissions
    And permissions cascade properly

  Scenario: Audit trail
    Given any user performs an action
    When the action completes
    Then it's logged with user, role, timestamp
    And the audit log is immutable
    And compliance can search audit logs

As a System Administrator,
I want to control API usage rates,
So that the system remains stable and resources are fairly distributed.

Business Context:
API access enables integration but must be controlled to prevent abuse. Rate limiting ensures fair usage, protects system resources, and enables usage-based billing.
```

### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Feature: API Rate Limiting
  Background:
    Given API rate limiting is enabled
    And different tiers are configured

  Scenario: Basic rate limiting

    When I make 100 requests in 1 minute
    Then the first 60 succeed
    And remaining requests get 429 status
    And I see rate limit headers
    And reset time is provided

  Scenario: Tiered limits
    Given different subscription tiers exist
    When a premium user makes requests
    Then they get higher rate limits
    And limits are per endpoint
    And some endpoints have different limits

  Scenario: Quota management
    Given I have a monthly quota
    When I approach the limit
    Then I receive warning webhooks at 80%, 90%
    And see quota usage in headers
    And requests fail after quota exceeded

### Story Card: EF-004 - Monitoring and Alerting
```
Title: Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
ID: FOAP-043
Points: 1
Epic: Enterprise Features
Sprint: Sprint 12
Priority: Must Have (MoSCoW)

As a DevOps Engineer,
I want comprehensive monitoring of system health,
So that I can proactively address issues before users are impacted.

Business Context:
Financial systems require 99.9% uptime. Proactive monitoring enables quick issue resolution, capacity planning, and SLA compliance. Alerting ensures rapid incident response.
```

### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Feature: System Monitoring
  Background:
    Given monitoring infrastructure is deployed
    And alert rules are configured

  Scenario: Application metrics collection
    Given the application is running
    When I view the monitoring dashboard
    Then I see real-time metrics for all services
    And historical data for trend analysis
    And custom business metrics
    And performance percentiles

  Scenario: Alert triggering
    Given alert thresholds are set
    When API latency exceeds 2s for 5 minutes
    Then an alert is triggered
    And on-call engineer is paged
    And incident is created
    And escalation happens if not acknowledged

  Scenario: Log aggregation
    Given distributed services generate logs
    When I search for an error
    Then I can see correlated logs across services
    And trace requests through the system
    And filter by various attributes
```

  - Performance logging context manager
  - User context management

#### 2. `/backend/src/middleware/logging.py`
- **Purpose**: HTTP request/response logging middleware
- **Components**:
  - `RequestLoggingMiddleware`: Logs all HTTP requests and responses
  - `PerformanceLoggingMiddleware`: Tracks request performance metrics
  - `create_request_id_middleware()`: Simple request ID injection
- **Features**:
  - Automatic request ID generation and header injection
  - Request/response logging with sensitive data filtering
  - Slow request detection and logging
  - Exception handling and logging

#### 3. `/backend/src/main.py` (Updated)
- **Changes**: Integrated logging configuration and middleware
- **Features**:
  - Application lifespan logging (startup/shutdown events)
  - Middleware stack configuration
  - Automatic logging initialization

#### 8. `/backend/src/core/dependencies.py` (Fixed)
- Fixed import issues with database session management
- Aligned with database module structure

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Environment-Based Configuration
- **Production**: JSON formatted logs for log aggregation systems
- **Development**: Colored console output for human readability
- **Automatic Detection**: Based on `DEBUG` environment variable

### 2. Structured Logging
- JSON format with consistent field naming
- Support for nested objects and complex data structures
- Automatic metadata injection (app name, version, environment)

### 3. Request Tracing
- Unique request ID generation for each HTTP request
- Correlation ID support for distributed operations
- Request/response logging with timing information
- Context propagation throughout request lifecycle

### 4. Performance Monitoring
- Built-in performance logging with context managers
- Request duration tracking
- Slow request detection and alerting
- Operation-level performance metrics

### 5. Security Features
- Automatic sensitive data censoring (passwords, tokens, API keys)
- Safe header logging with authentication data filtering
- No credential leakage in log outputs

### 6. User Context Tracking
- User ID and username context binding
- Request-scoped user information
- Audit trail capabilities

## Example Log Outputs

### Production Mode (JSON)
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-07-22T19:43:56.229539+00:00",
  "level": "INFO",
  "event": "login_successful",
  "app_name": "Front Office Analytics Platform",
  "app_version": "0.1.0",
  "environment": "production",
  "user_id": "user_123",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "role": "analyst",
  "request_id": "req_456def"
}
```

### Development Mode (Colored Console)
```
2025-07-22T19:43:56.229539+00:00 | INFO | login_successful | app_name='Front Office Analytics Platform' user_id='user_123' email='user@example.com' | auth.py:85
```

## Integration Points

### 1. FastAPI Application
- Automatic middleware integration
- Lifespan event logging
- Request/response cycle coverage

### 2. API Endpoints
- Easy integration with existing endpoints
- User context setting for authenticated requests
- Error handling with structured logging

### 3. Service Layer
- Performance logging for business operations
- Error handling with full context
- Operation tracing capabilities

### 4. Database Operations
- Query performance tracking
- Connection monitoring
- Transaction logging support

## Monitoring Tool Compatibility

The JSON output format is compatible with:
- **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Datadog**
- **AWS CloudWatch**
- **Google Cloud Logging**
- **Azure Monitor**
- **Prometheus/Grafana** (for metrics extraction)

## Usage in Development

### Basic Logging
```python
from src.utils.logging import logger

logger.info("user_action", user_id="123", action="document_upload")
```

### Performance Tracking
```python
from src.utils.logging import LoggerAdapter

log_adapter = LoggerAdapter(logger)
with log_adapter.performance("database_query"):
    results = await database.execute(query)
```

### Context Setting
```python
from src.utils.logging import set_user_context, set_request_id

set_request_id("req_123")
set_user_context(user_id="user_456", username="analyst@company.com")
```

## Testing

- Comprehensive unit tests covering all components
- Middleware integration tests
- Configuration validation tests
- Mock-based testing for external dependencies

## Benefits

1. **Observability**: Complete visibility into application behavior
2. **Debugging**: Rich context for troubleshooting issues
3. **Performance**: Built-in performance monitoring
4. **Security**: Automatic sensitive data protection
5. **Scalability**: JSON format ready for log aggregation
6. **Compliance**: Audit trail capabilities for regulatory requirements
7. **Developer Experience**: Easy-to-use APIs and clear documentation

## Next Steps

The logging system is ready for immediate use. Consider these future enhancements:

1. **OpenTelemetry Integration**: Add distributed tracing capabilities
2. **Log Sampling**: Implement sampling for high-traffic scenarios
3. **Custom Metrics**: Extract business metrics from logs
4. **Alerting Rules**: Define log-based alerting thresholds
5. **Log Retention**: Configure appropriate retention policies
